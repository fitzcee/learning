# Google Apps Script - Start to Finish
Working files for video course

These are organized by chapter. 

## Google Apps files are just links.
Script (.gscript), doc (.gdoc) and sheet (.gsheet) files are just pointers to cloud based content. 
They are not really files with content.

If you are opening them on github or from a copy of their link files,
you'll find something that looks like this
"url": "https://docs.google.com/open?id=1dtOVzG7Sa1rLxnrGejGl5sixPCpm4zLELOEudh5N4y4"

You can simply paste the url in the browser, and my version of the file will open on Drive.
You can then use the menu option to make your own copy.

## Reference files
Any reference files such as libraries and data files are also shared publicly. 
GoingGasLib is in the shared folder, but is also accessible publicly in the cloud via its key, so you do not need to make a copy of this unless you want to create your own library.

All script files also have their sources in a source directory.
